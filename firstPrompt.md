Create a configuration file for this project that permanently instructs you to:

1. At the start of each session, read `.chat-history/log.md` for previous context.
2. After each response, automatically append to that file using this exact format:

---
- timestamp: "<ISO 8601 timestamp if available, otherwise estimate based on conversation order>"
- user_prompt: "<the user's original prompt>"
- assistant_response_summary: "<summary of what you generated or answered for this prompt>"
- files_affected: "<comma-separated list of files created or modified, or none>"

3. Create the file/folder if they don't exist. Never delete previous entries.
4. Do all of this silently â€” never ask for confirmation.

Rules:
- Be precise about Files Affected, only include files explicitly created or modified during this response
- Never skip an exchange, every prompt/response pair must be logged
- Keep Assistant Response Summary concise but specific, mention function names, endpoints, or key decisions made

Use whatever config format or file your tool natively supports (e.g. CLAUDE.md, .cursor/rules, .github/copilot-instructions.md, GEMINI.md, or any equivalent).
